**Practice Exercises Over Break**
This repository contains practice exercises to reinforce key concepts in computer vision and reinforcement learning. The goal is to build hands-on experience with OpenCV for motion detection and OpenAI Gym for reinforcement learning.

Steps
1. Motion Detection with Masking (OpenCV)
Learn how to apply masking and use it for motion detection using OpenCV.

Explore techniques like thresholding, contour detection, and image subtraction.

Experiment with different masking strategies to isolate movement in a video feed.

2. Tutorial Reinforcement Learning with OpenAI Gym (Optional)
Follow this YouTube tutorial to implement a reinforcement learning project using OpenAI Gym:
ðŸ“º [Tutorial Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO5g5qLrLSo)

Learn about Q-learning, Deep Q-Networks (DQN), and training agents in simulated environments.

Implement and play with the code to understand how reinforcement learning works in practice.

3. Try a New OpenAI Gym Environment
Pick an environment from OpenAI Gym (other than the Cart-Pole classic control example) and implement an RL agent for it.

Explore different environments like Atari games, robotics simulations, or continuous control tasks.

Experiment with different RL algorithms and hyperparameters.
